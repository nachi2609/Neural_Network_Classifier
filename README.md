# Neural_Network_Classifier

### Implemented a multiclass neural network classifier with  one hidden layer. 

#### Training  on the MNIST data (train on int-train and evaluated  on int-dev. 

  1.ipnyb file contains entire implementation and convergence criteria.\
  2.We have validated our implementation by running our classifier on some XOR data.\
  3.Experimented with at least four different configurations and document the internal.
   
   
#### Please refer graph plots for model performance with different activation functions
   
### We have used three activation functions
  1.Tanh \
  2.Sigmoid \
  3.ReLU 
  
##### Other files for training and testing.
